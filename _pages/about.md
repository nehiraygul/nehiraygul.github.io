I am a PhD student at the research training group [Nominal Modification](https://nominal-modification.de/) at Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. My research interests primarily lie in the area of psycholinguistics (interpretation and production) and its interfaces with syntax and semantics. I find scope, binding and anaphora particularly interesting and am currently working on inverse scope phenomena in German and Turkish.
